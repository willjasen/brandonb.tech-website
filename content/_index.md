#### Technology should work on our behalf, not the other way around

My focus is on creating efficient, user-friendly computing environments that leave more time to work — and relax.  My philosophy is that automation and efficiency is essential, and responsive & friendly support fills in when things go awry.  When issues do arise, incorporating solutions back into automation ensures a manageable, scalable means of problem solving.

#### The beauty is in the details

The small things can often be taken for granted.  I strive to perfect the details, whether it’s within the computing environment, end user support, or customer service.  Cohesion for all parts makes for a productive relationship.

#### Make everyone happy

IT isn’t just about servers and networking, it’s about the people who use it too.  My goal is to create a complete end-user experience that is pleasant - that means minimized errors and high uptime.  Happy users make for a happy support staff.  When users are productive, so are the objectives at hand.
